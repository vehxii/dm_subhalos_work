Past Projects Portfolio:

1. VCARRS (Vera Mimbsborne, Cory Francis, Andrew Pitts, Reilly Fastring, Rigby Araki, Stephen Canino) - July 2024

→ SDSU STARS Program Final Project

→ Calculated dark matter content of around 200 spiral and elliptical galaxies using Marvin, a tool for accessing and visualizing the MaNGA survey (part of the larger SDSS-IV data release)

→ Used the built-in stellar velocity and cumulative mass maps to calculate rotation curves and luminosity measurements

2. Dark Matter Summer Research (Dr. Ethan O. Nadler, Sandip Roy (postdoc), Roxanne Lai, Stephen Canino) - Summer 2025

→ Calculated a variety of plots using data from the Symphony Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations (Nadler et al. 2023), including subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) and mass accretion histories (MAHs) at various redshifts

→ Jupyter Notebooks detailing all work are included on my page!

→ Goal is to find a correlation between subhalo counts and mass accretion history, which might help constrain the mechanisms and rates which dark matter subhalos can be created within a host halo
